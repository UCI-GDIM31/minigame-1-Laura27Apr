## Devlog
To better understand the relationship between Components, GameObjects, and Scenes, we can consider an example from our daily lives: the final group project in some university courses. In this context, a Scene represents the final project presented. GameObjects represent the group members. Components are elements attached to GameObjects and can be understood as the tasks that each group member is responsible for completing within the project, as well as the resources assigned to them. Just as a complete scene in a game requires various GameObjects to be built, completing a project requires the diverse skills and contributions of each team member. What determines how these GameObjects function are the components attached to them.
